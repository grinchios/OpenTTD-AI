- Define the manager class and its functions
- Need a way to select a good vehicle type for the current manager type, buses for inner city travel will be slower and cheaper but thats okay
, inter city we would like faster and more resilient vehicles if breakdowns are on.
- Choosing a route should consider settings like breakdowns and speed of vehicles with the profit dropoff rate, PAX over a long distance is good if they arrive quickly etc.
