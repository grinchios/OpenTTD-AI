# OpenTTD-AI
My AI for OpenTTD, will use primarily air  
Initial version from WrightAI with ideas from AIAI  

## Version 5
- Overhauled the codebase to an Object Oriented version
- Uses mail planes too now
- Needs some work on where the AI builds airports but this version is so much better than version 4

## Version 4
- Only uses passengers planes, basically a duplicate of WrightAI with some minor modifications
- Doesn't always buy the best planes it could but still does fairly well
